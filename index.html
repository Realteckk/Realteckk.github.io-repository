        A Professional staff at one of Nigeria's largest communities 
      </h2>
      <p>The combined experience i have working at top companies has allowed me to develope a skillset that 
        helps me in not just development,but in every aspect of any business.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm proud to announce that i'm now working at one of Nigeria's largest communities teaching
        other young minds like me about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new
        world of opportunities.
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        As a developer,you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
        <br><br>
        A quote i live by perfectly illustrates what i mean.
        <br><br>
        "How big would you dream,if you knew you wouldn't fail?" you've already gone through the hardest parts 
        being a developer,it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.
        <br><br>
        I'm happy to chat over a coffee sometime about how i can help your company.
